# Iris-dataset-Deep-learning-Classification
I have used deep learning artificial neural network model to classify the IRIS FLOWER dataset which is a structured dataset. It predicts the class of the flower based on the input provided, the process involves data preprocessing, creating, training and evaluating a model, and lastly making predictions with the model with 93% accuracy rate.
